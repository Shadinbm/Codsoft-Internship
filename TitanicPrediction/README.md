# Titanic Survival Prediction – CodSoft Internship

This repository contains the work I completed during my **one-month Data Science internship at CodSoft**.  
The main objective of this project was to apply **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models** to predict passenger survival on the **Titanic dataset**.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Domain:** Data Science / Machine Learning  
- **Duration:** 1 Month (Internship at CodSoft)  
- **Dataset:** Titanic (Kaggle / Open-source)  
- **Goal:** Predict survival of passengers based on socio-demographic and travel-related features

## 🔎 Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values (Age, Embarked, Fare)  
   - Encoding categorical features (Sex, Embarked, Pclass)  
   - Feature engineering (Age groups: Child, Adult, Senior)  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Survival rates by class, sex, age group, and embarkation port  
   - Correlation and covariance analysis  
   - Visualization of patterns using Seaborn & Matplotlib  

3. **Modeling**
   - Implemented **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM**  
   - Compared classification reports, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
   - Applied class balancing techniques (SMOTE, class weights)  

4. **Findings**
   - **Females, children, and 1st-class passengers** had higher survival rates  
   - **Males, seniors, and lower-class passengers** had lower survival rates  
   - Logistic Regression achieved **80% accuracy**, slightly outperforming Random Forest (78%)

## 📊 Results
- **Logistic Regression:** Accuracy = 80%, balanced performance  
- **Random Forest:** Accuracy = 78%, strong but slightly biased  
- **SVM:** Lower survivor recall without balancing
